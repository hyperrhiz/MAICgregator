<h1>Provide Information about Trustees</h1>
<p>Select the school below to update information about known trustees.  If there are no trustees found, please provide a source that lists, at the very least, the names of the trustees.  (If you don't see your desired school listed, please <a href="/download" title="download link">download</a> MAICgregator and use it on your school of choice.)  All information will be reviewed before it is entered into the public database.  If you want to provide information about a different trustee, simply select his or her name.  If you want to provide trustee information about a different school, please reload the page.</p>

$# add a "captcha" thing, and maybe a hidden form element or two...

$# We need to do the following:
$#  Setup page that lists the available schools
$#  Do an ajax request that gets the trustees for that school
$#      If there are no trustees, put form that gives place to get trustee info
$#  Put trustee names in list
$#  Upon selecting trustee, have options for bio and place of work
$#  On submit, send via ajax and store in separate RDF store for review
