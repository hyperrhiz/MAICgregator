<h1>MAICgregator 0.1.5</h1>
<h2>Now with unnecessary animations!</h2>

<p>Three main new features in this release:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Toolbar button for easy turning on/off</li>
    <li>Trustee image replacement now searches <i>all</i> images, including those pesky CSS ones.  Your page looks crazier than ever!</li>
    <li>The beginning of unnecessary Web 2.0 animations; coming next version: a new animated "redacted" mode!</li>
</ul>
