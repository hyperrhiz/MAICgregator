h3.  The Military-Academic-Industrial-Complex (MAIC)

It is well-known that former US President Eisenhower, in his 1961 farewell address to the nation, wanted to speak not only of the "military-industrial complex":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_industrial_complex that became the renowned phrase that it is, but rather of the military-<em>academic</em>-industrial complex, what we are here calling the MAIC.  Additionally, former Senator <a href="http://www.countercurrents.org/us-turse290404.htm">J. William Fulbright</a> spoke of the same thing in 1968.  As you visit US college and university campuses today, you easily see the extent of the military-academic-industrial complex.  Companies and academia are big business, and while the "end" of the cold war took away the spotlight from the relationship between academic and the military, "defense" monies easily finds their way into the university and out again to defense contractors.  Corporations fund endowed professorships, schools outsource fundamental operations such as their bookstore to corporations like Barnes and Noble, and universities offer advertising to companies on brand-new plasma screens installed in said bookstores.  Advertisements for everything from spring break vacations Mexico to Cancun to jobs at Lockheed Martin designing the latest in weapons technology plaster the walls of today's campuses.

This is all the more heinous at this contemporary moment given the interrelationships between universities, corporations, and capital.  The precipitous fall in university endowments is linked not only to the contemporaneous use of business models in the governance of universities, but also on the transplantation of corporate fund managers to highly-paid positions in the university hierarchy.  This is an invasive transplantation, as fund managers more accustomed to the risk profiles of hedge funds are ill-equipped to managing much more conservative portfolios such as those of a university, an institution that is predicated on continued existence without the possibility of being "sold" or "broken up" in any type of "bankruptcy" proceedings.  Indeed, it has been reported that "Harvard University's endowment was, at one point recently, leveraged 105 percent":http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/economy/21harvard.html?pagewanted=1 ...meaning that it had invested more than it actually had on hand.  While this may be a common tactic of those who come from a corporate finance background, it becomes downright distasteful in the context of an institution such as a university.  Yet the university jumped on the bandwagon of hedge funds, real estate speculation, and investment in private equity, enticed by the thought of big returns.  However, as soon as the investments went down, the endowments tanked as well.

While the day-to-day functioning of the university is vested in the offices of the President, Provost, and various Vice-Presidents, the overall strategic direction is governed by a Board of Trustees or, in the case of public universities, Regents.  Private colleges and universities are actually chartered as non-profit corporations and, as such, legally require these Boards in order to exist.  Academic Boards function quite similarly to their counterparts in the corporate world, the Board of Directors: trustees have final say on all tenure decisions, they set fund-raising goals, decide on capital projects, and help set the direction of endowment investment.  Thus, they are also implicated in the horrible decline in endowment monies experienced by many schools in the last year.  However, their activities and deliberations are done almost entirely in secret: while there is a token movement towards transparency in the convening of public "forums" during regular trustee meetings, most proceedings are done behind closed doors.  Such lack of transparency has been one of the most prominent issues raised by the recent protesters at <a href="http://takebacknyu.com/2009/02/19/nyu-occupied/" title="nyu demands">NYU</a> and the <a href="http://newschoolinexileblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/our-demands-for-negotiation-750pm.html" title="new school demands">New School</a>.  

Indeed, the links between schools, corporations, governments, military activities around the world become rather frightening once you start putting it all together--which is of course why there is a lack of transparency in the first place.  For example, Cornell University has "received gifts from former Citigroup CEO and chairman Sanford I. Weill totalling in the hundreds of millions of dollars":http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April09/WeillGift.html for its medical school in New York City.  Citigroup, through its subsidiary Citibank, has "additionally been involved in providing loans to a rebel group in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) associated with the brutal civil war":http://www.business-humanrights.org/Documents/Vuyelwa-Kuuya-on-UN-Expert-Panel-DRC-Nov-2008.doc in which millions have been killed that is _additionally_ funded in part through the "sale of coltan":http://mason.gmu.edu/%7Ejmantz/Improvisational%20Economies.pdf , a necessary mineral that eventually is used in high-performance tantalum capacitors like those used in modern electronic equipment.  There are reasons why some people do not want these sorts of links to be made...

h3.  _Alter_-data mining

Nevertheless, these links _do_ need to be made, and are being made everyday by the powerful through the practice of data mining.  Data mining as a term is a remarkable bit of rhetorical slippage or slight of hand.  In the juxtaposition of two terms we see the elision of disparate meanings and the movement of concepts from one word to the other.  "Mining" used to refer primarily to the material, the digging into the earth in order to extract something of value, something that was hidden on the surface but became clear only through the hard labor of others--immigrants or the poor--in order to be sold as raw commodities used in the production of further commodities in the chain.  Iron, gold, diamonds, copper, tin, aluminum, coltan--these are things that are mined.  They can be held in your hand or in the back of an enormous truck.  Mining takes something produced not by humans and turns it into something that can be sold, that is now "owned".  Mining creates land disputes as "rights" are now bought and sold for the contents of that which cannot be seen, but which can be sensed through various forms of technologies that can "penetrate" the earth.  Mining is the creation of gashes in the earth in order to further our appetite for other items in which the mined material does not "appear" at all.  Mining is still a vital component of the world economy and can be especially harmful and contentious, as we have seen with coltan and as threatens to happen with "lithium in Bolivia":http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7707847.stm .  Data, on the other hand, is perceived to be the most immaterial.  It is the thing that can travel "instantaneously" from one place to another, that has no physical analog, that does not obey physical laws.  Yet data is materiality at its most fundamental: it always already exists as magnetic bits on a platter, or the movement of electrical or optic pulses down a wire or fiber; it is subject to the same physical laws as everything else in the universe.  Data's meaning--other than in its form as abstraction--is always imposed from the outside; the bytes that make up a text file are meaningless without a lookup table that says the number "68" represents the letter "D" or the number "100" represents the letter "d" (and yes, case is important or "sensitive").  Can these mappings be "owned"?  Can data become a commodity?

Of course these are questions that have obvious answers today, and it is partially due to the rhetorical power of a term such as "data mining".  The list of situations in which corporations, the military, and the government use data mining is enormous and growing constantly.  To take a couple of recent examples:

* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) created the "Total Information Awareness":http://epic.org/privacy/profiling/tia/tiasystemdescription.pdf program in 2002 that, under an "Information Awareness Office", would "imagine, develop, apply, integrate, demonstrate and transition information technologies, components and prototype, closed-loop, information systems that will counter asymmetric threats by achieving total information awareness".  While many found their "logo":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IAO-logo.png to be beyond creepy, it was the danger of this mass surveillance system that brought the program to a halt after extensive proceedings by members of the United States Congress.
* "Acxiom":http://www.acxiom.com is one of the largest and most powerful of the companies that market "data products":http://www.acxiom.com/data-products to corporations that help them "segment" "customers" on a variety of axes.  One of the more interesting "products" they offer is a report on the "underbanked":http://www.acxiom.com/77348/UnderBanked_Indicator which, in their words, "helps marketers find potentially profitable underserved consumers who lack formal banking relationships and represent an untapped pool for checking, savings, fee-based, prepaid or starter credit services."  This is done through mining various types of public databases and connecting that data with information from the credit bureaus to find those that are not in the latter.

These data mining endeavors function on the premise of perfect, or near-perfect data: that the data they produce, use, and sell gives an "accurate" picture of the situation and cannot be gamed or interpreted differently.  Yet, as anyone who has taken a statistics course knows, "garbage in equals garbage out".  Data mining rests on an enormous, shifting mound of assumptions that models that can be endlessly debated and tweaked.  And the data that forms the "inputs" to these models can additionally be manipulated, through simple changes to the name (as those subject to misplacement on terrorist "watch lists" know all-to-well) or flooding of data aggregation sources with "wrong" data (as we shall see in a moment).

Nevertheless, we can consider an alternative form of data mining, one we might want to call _alter_-data mining.  Taking into account all of the caveats that we have already mentioned, as well as the conceptual issues with data mining in and of itself, we might be able to turn data mining _techniques_ on the powerful themselves, using the results to being to form one alternative mapping of the situation, while in the process commenting on the role of data mining in society.  This is the main conceptual foundation of the MAICgregator project: that perhaps we might be able to aggregate some of this data together, and through direct and poetic presentations of it, turn it into actionable information.

"Actually, we borrowed the idea from a trick of the official photographers of the Prussian army regiments.  They used to have elaborate oleolithographed mounts, representing a group of uniformed men with a barracks or a landscape in the background, but with the faces cut out; in these mounts, the photographers then inserted photographic portraits of the faces of their customers, generally colouring them later by hand.  But the aesthetic purpose, if any, of this very primitive kind of photomontage was to idealize reality, wheras the Dada photomonteur set out to give to something entirely unreal all the appearances of something real that had actuall been photographed."
