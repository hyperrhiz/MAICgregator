    <p>Ever seen the logo for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/            Draper_Labs" title="wikipedia article about draper labs">Draper Labs</a>?</p>

    <p>Draper has a <a href="http://draper.com/fellow/fellow.html">graduate     fellow</a> program that allows you (if you are an MIT-affiliated graduate       student) to work on such exciting areas as "Tactical Intelligence,              Surveillance, and Reconnaissance" with projects in "Precision Aerial Delivery"  and "Guided Munitions Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&amp;C)".             Additionally, Draper is looking for partners in their "<a href="http://draper.  com/researcher/researcher.html">University Research and Development (URAD)</a>" program that has a number of specific application areas, including</p>
    <blockquote>
        The Strategic and Space GN&amp;C Systems Critical Technical Capability  addresses the hardware, algorithms and software needs that are specific for     strategic and space GN&amp;C systems. There are several items that comprise     this capability, including: ascent systems, entry systems, missiles, spacecraft on-orbit control, and autonomous rendezvous and docking, to name a few. Any     specific inertial technology required for this area will be drawn from the      Inertial Systems capability described above.  Proposals are sought in the areas of system concepts leveraging novel GN&amp;C algorithms and inertial            instruments/sensors. Application areas include (but are not limited to)         spacecraft GN&amp;C, <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2001missiles/bille.pdf"  title="see slide 10 and slide 15">prompt global strike</a>, and <em>re-entry    body GN&amp;C</em>. Design approaches and modeling concepts for high-           performance (jitter/size/power/mass) Precision Pointing Systems, low noise      pointing, and/or high sensitivity (e.g. gravimetric) for space-based systems    are also sought.

    <p>It doesn't take a rocket scientist (even if that's what they're looking  for) to understand that Draper is looking for people to work on space-based     weapons systems.</p>
   <p>Draper <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2009/01/30/146m-missile-    contract-for-draper/">recently received nearly $$150 million</a> to work on     "guidance systems" for an updated version of Trident II nuclear missles         deployed on submarines.</p>
   <p>Draper's headquarters is in Cambridge, MA, a couple of blocks away from   MIT.  Their windows are incredibly dark, ostensibly to prevent espianage.       Draper has been the subject of <a href="http://www.theharvardcrimson.com/       article.aspx?ref=157772" title="Harvard Crimson Article about                   protests">numerous protests</a> over the years.</p>
