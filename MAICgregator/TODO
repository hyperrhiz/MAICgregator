* Look to see if IRS records of universities give a list of trustees
    * YUP, through the 990 form.  But have to do OCR and OCR cleanup
    * Other sources of looking up trustees?  Open govt sources?
* Work on preferences and the saving and restoring of them
    Include:
        DoD STTR
        DoD Research Grants
        Trustee corporate search
        PR News Search
        Homeland Security Grants
        NSF Grants
    Modify all pages, or only those with news?
* See how to lookup university names: WHOIS?  Geolocation search?
    *  whois.educause.net, port 43
* Write code that interacts with STTR and USASpending POST interfaces (How can we do this in PHP?)
* Write code to:
    * Interject HTML on every page
    * Interject HTML only on .edu pages
    * Interject HTML only on pages with news
* Write code to deal with XML database (Can we connect this to more traditional database?  i.e., getting things from the STTR database?  and can we use an XML serialization of RDF for storing trustee data?) (and thsi should take care of returning XML data via ajax)

XML Storage with Berkeley DB XML:
http://commandline.org.uk/linux/native-xml-storage-db-xml-part-one/
http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/xml/index.html

Some python code:
from bsddb.db import *
from dbxml import *
mgr = XmlManager()
container = mgr.createContainer("test.MAICxml")
container.putDocument(bookName, foobar, uc)
document = container.getDocument(bookName)
s = document.getContent()
document.getName()
container.sync()
qc = mgr.createQueryContext()
results = mgr.query("collection('test.MAICxml')//project_and_award_info[maj_agency_cat='Department of Defense']", qc)
for value in results:
    print value.asString()
