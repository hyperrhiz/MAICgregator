$var title: About the MAICgregator project
<h1>A statement about MAICgregator</h1>
<h3>6 April 2009</h3>
<p>It is well-known that former US President Eisenhower, in his farewell address to the nation, wanted to speak not only of the "military-industrial complex" that became the renowned phrase it is, but rather of the "military-<em>academic</em>-industrial complex", what we are calling here the MAIC.  His advisors suggested that he leave out academia because of morale concerns at the height of the cold war (get ref from University in Chains).  As you visit US college and university campuses today, you begin to see the extent of the military-academic-industrial complex.  Companies and academia are big business, with the military continuing its foundational role through funding programs and support of defense department contractors and companies.  Corporations fund endowed professorships, schools outsource fundamental activities like their bookstore to corporations like Barnes and Noble, and universities offer advertising to companies on brand-new plasma screens installed in said bookstores.  Advertisements for everything from spring break trips to Cancun to jobs at Lockheed Martin designing the latest in weapons technology plaster the walls of today's campuses.</p>

<p>This is all the more heinous at this contemporary moment given the interrelationships between universities, corporations, and capital.  The precipitous fall in university endowments is linked not only to the contemporaneous use of business models in the governance of universities, but also on the transplantation of corporate fund managers to the university.  This is an invasive transplantation, as fund managers used to the risk profiles of hedge funds are ill-equipped to managing much more conservative portfolios such as those of a university, an institution that is predicated on continued existance without the possibility of being "sold" or "broken up" in any type of "bankrupcy" proceedings.  Indeed, it has been reported that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/economy/21harvard.html?pagewanted=1">Harvard University was, at one point, leveraged 105 percent</a>...meaning that it had invested more than it actually had on hand.  While this may be a common tactic of those who come from a corporate finance background, it becomes downright distasteful in the context of an institution such as a university.  Yet the university jumped on the bandwagon of hedge funds, real estate speculation, and investiment in private equity, enticed by the thought of big returns.  However, as soon as the investments went down, the endowments tanked as well.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with data mining?</p>
<p>Data mining as a term is a remarkable bit of rhetorical slippage or slight of hand.  In the juxtaposition of two terms we see the elision of disparage meanings and the movement of concepts from one word to the other.  "Mining" used to refer to the material, the digging into the earth in order to extract something of value, something that was hidden on the surface but became clear only through the hard labor of others---immigrants or the poor---in order to be sold as raw commodities used in the production of further commodities in the chain.  Iron, gold, diamonds, copper, tin, aluminum, coltan---these are things that are mined.  They can be held in your hand or in the back of an enormous truck.  Mining takes something produced not by humans---something absten the human hand---and turns it into something that can be sold, that is now "owned".  Mining creates land disputes as "rights" are now bought and sold for the contents of that which cannot be seen, but which can be sensed through various forms of technologies that can "penetrate" the earth.  Mining is the creation of gashes in the earth in order to further our appitite for other items in which the mined material does not "appear" at all.  Data, on the other hand, is perceived to be the most immaterial.  It is the thing that can travel "instantaneously" from one place to another, that has no physical analog, that does not obey physical laws.  Yet data is materiality at its most fundamental: it always already exists as magnetic bits on a platter, or the movement of electrical or optic pulses down a wire or fiber; it is subject to the same physical laws as everything else in the universe.  Data's meaning---other than in its form as abstraction---is always imposed from the outside; the bytes that make up a text file are meaningless without a lookup table that says the number "68" represents the letter "D" or the number "97" represents the letter "a" (and yes, case is important or "sensitive").  Can these mappings be "owned"?  Can data become a commoditity?</p>
<p>Of course these are questions that have obvious answers today, and it is partially due to the rhetorical power of a term such as "data mining".  Indeed, it is possible to buy and sell data that is "mined" from the activities of people online.</p>

<p>data cut-ups, "data mining" as rhetorical slippage</p>
<p>"Actually, we borrowed the idea from a trick of the official photographers of the Prussian army regiments.  They used to have elaborate oleolithographed mounts, representing a group of uniformed men with a barracks or a landscape in the background, but with the faces cut out; in these mounts, the photographers then inserted photographic portraits of the faces of their customers, generally colouring them later by hand.  But the aesthetic purpose, if any, of this very primitive kind of photomontage was to idealize reality, wheras the Dada photomonteur set out to give to something entirely unreal all the appearances of something real that had actuall been photographed."
